                            <div class="textleft">I studied film at Loyola Marymount back in the 90’s. After working for Disney and MTV for a while, I figured out that graphic design was more my speed. It turns out that I could not fulfill my lifelong dream of writing for the sitcom Cheers. It had been off the air for 10 years by the time I got to college.<br>
<br>


So I started creating titles for student films and learning Photoshop. Photoshop actually fit on two floppy discs. I tried making fake ID’s in my dorm room with my Mac LC and Apple LaserWriter. None of the fake ID’s worked as they were printed in black and white.<br>
<br>
Passionate and curious about design, people, and business, the favorite part of my career has been the people that I’ve had the honor to work with during my time as a designer. Yup. That’s me with Too $hort.<br>
<br>


I spent a week with Jack Canfield a few years ago. He refused to trade shirts with me. That guy in the background is named Tom. He was Canadian.
